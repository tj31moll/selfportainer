### Notice:
Currently most of my dev time is being spent on [Yacht](https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/Yacht/tree/vue) if you would like something added please consider making a pull request with your addition and I'll work on getting it added when I'm able to. Information about how to structure a block (for an app) is available [here](https://portainer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/templates.html)

_portainer 2.0 templates are available [here](https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/selfhosted_templates/tree/portainer-2.0) in the portainer 2.0 branch. The Template URL is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SelfhostedPro/selfhosted_templates/portainer-2.0/Template/template.json`._

# Portainer Templates for Selfhosted Projects/Homelabs

*for the OMV5 version use the OMV5 branch*

### Prerequisites

1. A server/NAS with docker installed
2. A Portainer setup.

*Want something we don't have? Make an issue and we'll work on adding it*

### Installing

2. Enable Use external templates
3. Add the url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SelfhostedPro/selfhosted_templates/master/Template/template.json` then go to app templates and hit refresh at the top.
